GENERAL INFORMATION

1. Titles of Datasets: 
-README_LUDEMANN_FUBC_DATA_2022.txt (describes all datasets in this https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061%2Fdryad.2rbnzs7qh DRYAD submission)
-FUBC_1_9.csv (includes fertilizer use by crop data from the 8 previously published reports (FUBC 1 to 8), as well as the fertilizer use data from the latest (9th) survey (FUBC 9) carried out by the International Fertilizer Association. It is important to note that the FUBC 9 data have been aggregated by crop categories that align to those used in the previous survey (FUBC 8)).
-Meta_data_FUBC_1_to_9.csv (includes meta-data associated with the FUBC_1_to_9.csv file.)
-FUBC_9_raw_data.csv (includes fertilizer use by crop data from the latest fertilizer use by crop survey.This file includes data where the crop names remained the same as those originally received by survey respondents. This file can be used to access the original crop information (for FUBC 9) that is otherwise lost from the FUBC_1_to_9.csv file due to crop aggregation).
-Meta_data_FUBC_9_raw_data.csv (includes meta-data associated with the FUBC_9_raw_data.csv file).
-IFA_Regions.csv (includes information shown in Appendix 1 as a csv file for programmatic ease of use).
-Meta_data_IFA_Regions.csv (includes meta-data associated with the IFA_Regions.csv file).
-Country_tables.xlsx (includes original fertilizer use by crop data from the latest survey with separate excel worksheets for each country. This file includes more information (as ‘Notes’) on how estimates were made for each crop and country).

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 

Latest fertilizer use by crop survey data
During 2020-2022 IFA collected and standardized FUBC data for the 2017-18 period, primarily through a survey of various country correspondents. As of July 2022 this is the most recent survey for FUBC data. Country correspondents were selected based on their knowledge for estimating fertilizer use, average fertilizer application rates and areas of crops for N, P2O5 and K2O for their respective country, and access to any locally available farm data.
Country correspondents were asked to complete the questionnaire with the greatest detail possible, or to provide data for the crop breakdown available in their country. The task of aligning the data with FAO crop area statistics was particularly challenging, and sometimes impossible. Even when correspondents were able to mostly follow the provided crop breakdown, crops that are minor in a country’s agriculture were often included in a group of crops or other crops. For example, for most EU countries, the data provided by Fertilizers Europe follow the crop breakdown that is specific to their own annual survey. In this crop breakdown, rice is grouped with rye, triticale and oats, soybean is grouped with sunflower and linseed, and cotton is not identified. 

Historic fertilizer use by crop survey data
For historic FUBC data the following sources had data manually extracted from the original pdf documents into a standardized format: 
•	FUBC report number 1: FAO et al. (1992)
•	FUBC report number 2: FAO et al. (1994)
•	FUBC report number 3: FAO et al. (1996)
•	FUBC report number 4: FAO et al. (1999)
•	FUBC report number 5: FAO et al. (2002)
•	FUBC report number 6: Heffer (2009)
•	FUBC report number 7: Heffer (2013)
•	FUBC report number 8: Heffer et al. (2017)
